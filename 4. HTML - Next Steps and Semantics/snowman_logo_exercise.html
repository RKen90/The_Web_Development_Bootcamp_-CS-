<!-- 
    Snowman Logo Exercise
It's time for more practice!  Please write an <h1> element to recreate the following image:

There is a snowman entity code.  Find it! (you will need to google it)

Use the registered trademark entity code (the circled R at the end) , AND be sure to make it superscript

Note: No one expects you to memorize any of the entity codes.  Get used to googling them! It's normal!
