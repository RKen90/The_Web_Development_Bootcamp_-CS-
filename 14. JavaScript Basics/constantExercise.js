/*
Our First Constants Exercise
Let's get some practice defining constants. 
In index.js, please define the following two variables:

Define a constant called boilingPointC and set it to 100. 
Define a second constant called boilingPointF and set it to 212. 
*/

const boilingPointC = 100;
const boilingPointF = 212;

console.log(boilingPointC);
console.log(boilingPointF);
